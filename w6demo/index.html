    <script>
        //everything must be written in JS between script starts and ends

        //declaration of variables - keyword 'var'; vars must be declared befoe or as they are defined, must be defined before they can be used

        var num //simple declaration

        //declare and assign at once

        var num1 = 10
        var num2 = 7
        
        var sum = num1 + num2

        //output

        //alert() pop-up window to browser to page; user must interact before further code is read

        //` ` denotes a literal string, makes it easier to display messages + stored value (similar to format) --> `${VAR}` displays stored value of var

        alert(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} is ${sum}`)

        //console.log() -- GREAT FOR TESTING! displays to console only, not for regular user

        console.log(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} is ${sum}`)

        //console.log will display JUST NUMS as a different color

        
        //input - gain data from the user with JS only
        //prompt() - prompts user for value with msg, further lines of code are not read until user hits ok/cancel/enter/esc

        //prompt("Enter your name:")

        var fname = prompt(`Enter your first name:`)

        console.log(fname)

        //prompt() returns strings(?)
        //concatenation - adding strings together

        var lname = prompt(`Enter your last name:`)

        var full = fname + " " + lname

        alert(`${full}?\nHuh. Can't say it's what I'd have picked for you. But if that's your name, that's your name.`)
        //escape sequences work too

        //returns from prompt() are strings meaning you must cast a value as number() if you want to do math with it

        var num = Number(prompt(`Enter a number:`))

        if (num === 7)
        {console.log(`num is a number and is 7`)}

        else if (num == 7)
        {console.log(`num is not a number and is 7`)}

        else
        {console.log(`num isn't 7`)}
