        <p style="border:2px solid green; font-size: large;">My name is Spencer Roucoulet and I am from Bristol, Connecticut, about a 2 hour drive from NEIT. I live on campus, because commuting 2 hours for 4 days a week is <i>absurd</i>. At this point though, I wouldn't even want to move off of campus because of the friends I made here. When on campus almost all of my free time is spent with said friends in the room 2 of them share. I used to have a roommate, but he left NEIT pretty much without warning, and now I have a corner room all to myself. It's a pretty great deal. When I'm not with my friends, and even sometimes when I am, you can find me playing my Switch. As of writing, I'm playing a lot of Ender Lilies and Fate/Extella Link. I also love reading and programming. A random fact about me is that I seem to have heightened sensitivity to tastes and textures. For example, soda <u>almost always</u> hurts to drink because of the carbonation. <br> I'm generally a calm, relaxed, and patient person. I can't even remember the last time I genuinely got <b>angry</b> at someone. I tend to overthink every chance I get, but at least that means everything I do is well-thought out.</p>
