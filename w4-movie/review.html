            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <h4><b>Spencer Roucoulet</b> <i>2.7.22</i></h4>
            <p><em>Knives Out</em> is a very fun movie with quite a varied cast. Daniel Craig's Detective Benoit Blanc is on the job, trying to figure out who killed Harlan. But while he's trying to reach the truth, Ana de Armas' Marta Cabrera is dragged into a war waged over the contents of Harlan's will, finding she's being hounded by everyone in the family, even those who once seemed sympathetic for her, seemingly except for Chris Evans' Ransom Drysdale. Evans steals the show, playing a character that couldn't be farther than his staple MCU character Captain America - and he does an amazing job playing a coarse, selfish asshole. <br><br>
            <span id="spoilertag"><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD.</strong></span>
            <span id="disc">seriously kt. if you want to watch ths movie and haven't, don't read the second paragraph. wouldn't want to spoil any of the movie</span><br>
            Partway through the movie, the genre does a switch-up, and the movie does an amazing job of displaying Marta's anxiety. She thinks she's the one who killed Harlan, and she and Ransom are running from Blanc and the police. When they're finally caught, Blanc (seemningly incorrectly) thinks Ransom did it, and has Marta help him catch Ransom, all the while Marta's just getting more and more anxious. At the end of the movie, it's revealed than Ransom was the killer, and the viewers are left wondering if Blanc had this figured out all along, and Marta was just being anxious for nothing. So many setups and payoffs, and everything makes perfect sense at the end.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>Rian Johnson (the director) said that Michael Shannon was by far the funniest person on set, and came up with a lot of his character's funny lines and physical moments, such as his triumphant arm-raise during the "eat shit" scene, and his retort: "I am not eating one iota of shit!"</li>
                    <li>In the commentary, director Rian Johnson described Chris Evans' entrance when the barking dogs surround him at the will reading as some of the best acting he's seen, because "dogs love Chris Evans, and Chris Evans loves dogs."</li>
                    <li>Rian Johnson contemplated cutting Blanc's doughnut speech, but Craig convinced him that it was good. Watching the actor deliver it sold him on keeping the entire thing.</li>
                </ul>
